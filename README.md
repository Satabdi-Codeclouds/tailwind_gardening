## Tailwind CSS

This portfolio has a consistent and unified design with a consistent look and feel across all pages. With Tailwind's pre-defined color schemes, typography, and spacing, I have created a cohesive design without worrying about the inconsistencies that may arise when styling from scratch.

I have learned the utility class's usage so that I easily replicate designs across different parts of my website without repeatedly writing custom CSS. This wide array of utility classes of Tailwind CSS has been combined to create a unique design.
